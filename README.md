**iPhone Sales Analysis**

Apple, a renowned mobile phone brand, has introduced multiple iPhone models since its launch, with new models being added almost every year, incorporating both software and hardware updates.

Data is being collected through various buying portals regarding customer feedback and other relevant information such as price and discount received by the customer.

As an analyst, we aim to explore the data and answer the following questions using the past data:

1. Which iPhone model is highest rated among the customers?
2. How many customers rated the highest rated iPhone model?
3. What is the relationship between the number of ratings and sale price?
4. What is the relationship between the number of ratings and discount percentage?

**Data**

- **Product data:** Product name, Product URL, MRP, Sale price, Discount Percentage, RAM, etc.
- **Customer data:** Number of ratings, Star ratings, Number of Reviews, etc.

**Tasks**

1. Clean the available data and look for the most liked iPhone model among the customers, and analyze any trend in the relationship between the highest rated model and its pricing.
2. Check if the discount percentage on the model influences the ratings of the product.

**Checkpoints**

1. Perform data cleaning and look for null values if any.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Select variables using the usual methods.
4. Sort the data points in decreasing order of the star rating.
5. Identify the top 10 product names with the highest star ratings.
6. Plot a bar chart with product names of the top 10 highest rated iPhone models on the x-axis and number of ratings on the y-axis.
7. Plot a scatter chart with the number of ratings on the x-axis and sale price on the y-axis, along with a trendline to analyze the relationship between the number of ratings and sale price.
